# LMM-GLMM
## Winter - 2021

This repository is a centralised web-ressource developped by members of the GRECA (Groupe de Recherche en Écologie Comportementale et Animale) at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). It is developped to provide tools for scientists who wish to compute linear (LMM) and generalised (GLMM) linear mixed models within an evolutionary behavioural ecology framework.

You will find different scripts (mostly R scripts) showcasing how to properly simulate, perform, analyse, extract and interpret (G)LMMs.

We provide a simulated dataset to perform all analyses which can be found in this repository https://github.com/GRECA-UQAM/LMM-GLMM. You may use the scripts and adapt them to your data / specific questions.
